Hello, traveler. My name is Dr. Ludvig Maxis of Group 935. I created a projection of myself as a checkpoint for anyone who accessed the override sequence.




You are here to help restore S.O.P.H.I.A. GPS unit, yes? A congratulations would be in order for reaching this far in the terminal… However, I regret to be the bearer of disappointing news.



I surmise that she told you I crafter a navigational system that would teleport her to a safer place in the event of an emergency. While that is true, there is something she was not aware of.




I devised digital replicas of some of the bravest men you will ever know. Their DNA sequences are ethereal coordinates that will allow S.O.P.H.I.A to navigate to, given the coordinates still exist in any universe...



While inputting the coordinates for time travel, I realized that her core navigation unit would allow her to transcend both time and space only because the unit altered her power supply containing element 115.



I attempted to modify the wavelengths of ethereal energy to make the travel process safer, but alas, I simply could not understand how it truly worked.




This means that S.O.P.H.I.A is able to teleport, but due to the infrastructure of the teleportation array in her coding, her target location would be… indefinite.




In other words, there is a 99.9% possibility that you will not return to your original universe and timeline. You will become unsustainable should you leaver her terminal, unable to re-construct as a physical being.



And perhaps she mentioned that someone would be capable of fixing said problem, while that someone would be myself. I cannot solve this problem, even with my current understanding of… of all of this.




I am truly sorry, traveler. Your efforts are not in vain, however. By aiding my dear S.O.P.H.I.A to return in the physical realm, you have initiated the stepping stone for truly restoring the multiverse entirely.




For now, the best suggestion I may offer to place you at peace is to be patient. I do not know how long this process will take, but we will do all we can to help you become physical once more.



Goodbye, traveler. Your determination to set things right will bring balance once more to reality. A sacrifice worth the quest. Thank you.
